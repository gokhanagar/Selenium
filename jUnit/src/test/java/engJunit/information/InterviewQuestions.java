    What type of waits do you use?
    * We can use implicit and explicit wait
    *
    *
    Which wait do you prefer?
    Why do you prefer that wait?
    * In depends on the case
    *
    * I prefer implicitly wait first, if it is not enough, I will try explicit wait
    *
    * I also use implicitly wait in my test base class, if it works I will use it.
    * If I need more, I will add explicit wait
    *
    * As a last solution we might try Thread.sleep()
    *
